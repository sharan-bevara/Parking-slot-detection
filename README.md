# Parking-slot-detection
This project is focused on parking spot detection and tracking using computer vision techniques. It utilizes OpenCV to process video frames from a parking lot to detect and monitor the status of parking spots. Initially, a mask image is used to identify the parking spot boundaries, and the connected components in the mask are analyzed using connectedComponentsWithStats to extract the bounding boxes of individual parking spots.
